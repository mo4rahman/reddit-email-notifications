# Reddit Email Notifications

This is a reddit web scraper using the PRAW library (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to scrape data (specifically titles of posts I am interested in) from a reddit subreddit called r/mechmarket. 
# 
I then send myself an email (specifically through the GMAIL server) to get a notification of these posts that have the criteria I am searching for.
